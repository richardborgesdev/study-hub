## About
I discovered I wanted to work with computers since my first typing course (1999) at 8 years old, driven by curiosity about how things work and a fascination with technology. Today, with a degree as a computer technician from Tupy Technical School (2008), a bachelor's in Computer Science from UDESC (2013), and a postgraduate degree in web technologies and applications from SENAC (2018), I remain passionate about the field and always inspired to find new ways to acquire knowledge.
